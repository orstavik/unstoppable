/**
 * Upgrade the Event.prototype.cancelBubble property.
 *
 * event.cancelBubble now returns:
 *  0: the event has not been stopped. Old value: false.
 *     No stopPropagation() nor stopImmediatePropagation() has been called on the event
 *     (since it last completed a propagation).
 *  1: the event has been stopped. Old value: true.
 *  2: the event has been stopped. Old value: true.
 *     But, 2 instead of 1 signals that the event is still in the same phase and
 *     at the same event target node as when the regular stopPropagation() call was made, and
 *     therefore can trigger other event listeners on the same node and in the same target phase.
 *  a) stopImmediatePropagation() has previously been called on the event.
 *     b) stopPropagation() or stopImmediatePropagation() has been called on the event before it began propagating.
 *     c) stopPropagation() has previously been called on the event from an event listener attached to another event
 *        target.
 *  2: stopPropagation() has been called on the event, but at the same currentTarget and eventPhase as the current
 *     event listener.
 *     Values 1 and 2 maps 1:1 to all instances where the original cancelBubble returns true.
 *
 * Problem 1: The original .cancelBubble returns true if either stopPropagation() or stopImmediatePropagation().
 * So, how to distinguish whether .stopPropagtion() or .stopImmediatePropagtion() has been called on the event?
 * How to see if another, later event listener will be triggered on the same eventTarget and eventPhase?
 *
 * Solution: Upgrade the return value of .cancelBubble to return 1 if no other event listener will be called and
 * 2 if other event listeners on the same event target and phase will be called.
 * This exposes the nuances of the state of the event.
 *
 *
 * Note 1. When stopPropagation() is called *before* the event has begun propagating,
 *         it will simply function as if stopImmediatePropagation() was called.
 *
 * Note 2. EventTarget.dispatchEvent(event) can be used to dispatch the same event object two or more times.
 *         let e1;
 *         window.addEventListener("weird-events", e=> console.log(e === e1, e.timeStamp, e1 = e), true);
 *         const e = new Event("weird-events");
 *         document.dispatchEvent(e);
 *         window.dispatchEvent(e);
 *         //false, 10, e
 *         //true, 10, e
 *
 *         This is not good behavior. But ok. To support it, we need to reset the state of cancelBubble for all event
 *         objects after dispatchEvent is called, but before the event actually begins its propagation.

/*
 * Problem 2: Calls to stopPropagation() from an event listener in another DOM, either from

 * to ensure in other ways. How can we avoid such problems?
 *
 * Solution a: disable stopPropagation(), stopImmediatePropagation(), and the cancelBubble setter completely.
 *
 * Solution b: scope stopPropagation(), stopImmediatePropagation(), and cancelBubble = true to only apply to event
 * listeners in the same DOM context. This requires a scoped stopPropagation() setup, and a scopedStopPropagation() setup
 * needs to know more precisely from what DOM contexts the call was made.
