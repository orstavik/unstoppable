# Antipattern: `prePropagationCallback()` and `postPropagationCallback()`

Using the extended event listeners, we can make an `Event.prePropagationCallback(type, cb)`. But. This would parallel the existing event listener system, like the GlobalEventHandlers such as `onclick`. Also worth noting here is that if the GlobalEventHandler functions had been selected to *always* first and *before* the addEventListener functions, then a GlobalEventHandler on `window` or `shadowRoot` would have functioned as a `.prePropagationCallback()`.

However, adding an `Event.prePropagationCallback()` leaves many questions without a good answer:
 * What should we do when we need more than one `prePropagationCallback()`? 
 * How can we access shadowRoots/documents for `composed: false` events handled?
 * Isn't it a source of complexity to have more than one queue for event listeners per target? Isn't that why the GlobalEventHandlers feel somewhat redundant and complexing? 

There can be many prePropagationCallbacks(), but only one postPropagationCallback()??
