The logic of event propagation is that DOM mutations should not influence the propagation path,
as this would become immensely complex, very quickly. For example, if event listeners mutating the DOM moved DOM-nodes
located in the propagation path up and down the propagation path, and these moves should be reflected in the nodes that
the event propagated to next, then this could cause infinite loops. Furthermore, new DOM nodes could be added and existing
DOM nodes removed, which would make it
uncertain which event listeners are triggered when and why. The browser's choice is therefore clear, the state of the DOM when the event
begins propagation, is LOCKED in the events composedPath(), and DOM mutations during an events propagation should not influence
the flow of propagation.

The composedPath() represents a snapshot of one line in the DOM that is an event's propagation path.

From this snapshot, most relationships between nodes are inferable. Easily. You can easily trace the
normal parent child relationships between elements, and assess which DOM context (ie. document) which element belonged
to at the beginning of propagation.

But. There is one notable exception: It is not possible looking at the composedPath() alone to see if an element was a)
slotted into another web component or b) was a fallback node of that slot. Both such elements would look the same.

To see if an element is a) slotted from the lightDOM of one document into the shadowDOM of another document, or b) is a
fallback node of a slot element inside the shadowDOM, you would need to perform a check:
1. has the element that is positioned as a child of a slot element in the composedPath() list the slot element as its
.assignedSlot property? if yes, then the element has been slotted into the shadowDOM; if no, then the element is a fallback
node of the slot element.
Alternative checks such as seeing if the slot === slottedElement.parentNode or if slot.assignedNodes().indexOf(slottedElement)>=0
works as well.

The problem with these tests, is that they all rely on the current state of the DOM. This means that if an event listener
mutates the DOM and moves either:
1. a slotted element into the shadowDOM from the lightDOM to become a childNode/fallback element of that same slot, or
2. vice versa, a childNode/fallback node is moved from the shadowDOM to the lightDOM to become a slotted element of that DOM,

it would be impossible to see *which DOM context the slotted/childNode element belonged to when the event began propagation*.
And this means that relevant information about the composedPath() is lost.
